# Exploring Surface Processes: How to Build Coupled Models

*A workshop at the 2019 AGU Fall Meeting,
December 7, San Francisco, California*

## Instructors

* Andrew Ashton
* Nicole Gasparini
* Irina Overeem
* Mark Piper

## Before the workshop

1. **Sign up for an account (see below)**: We'll do all of our
   computation on the CSDMS JupyterHub. This means that we won't have
   to spend time installing software during the workshop.
1. **Review the basics of working with Python and the Jupyter Notebook
   interface**: There are many online resources. Coding experience is
   not a prerequisite for this workshop and we will explain core
   concepts as we go along.
1. **Background reading**: Read the
   [Hobley et al., 2017](https://www.earth-surf-dynam.net/5/21/2017/esurf-5-21-2017.html)
   open source paper about Landlab
